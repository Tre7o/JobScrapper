# Getting started

This application is a web scrapper built using python and flask, to return a job listing

Ensure that the FLASK_APP environment variable is set correctly. This variable should contain the name of the Python file where your Flask application is defined.

In your case, assuming your Flask application is in a file named jobscrapper.py, set the FLASK_APP environment variable:
set FLASK_APP=app.py  # For Command Prompt
### OR
$env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"  For PowerShell

## Running the Application

Launch VSCode, open up a terminal, create a virtual environment using:
- python -m venv {virtual_env_name}

Activate the virtual environment with:
- {virtual_env_name}\Scripts\activate

Install the necessary packages using:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

To run jobscrapper.py:
flask --app jobscrapper run

To set flask in debug mode:
set FLASK_DEBUG=1 && flask run
