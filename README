Ensure that the FLASK_APP environment variable is set correctly. This variable should contain the name of the Python file where your Flask application is defined.

In your case, assuming your Flask application is in a file named app.py, set the FLASK_APP environment variable:

set FLASK_APP=app.py  # For Command Prompt
# OR
$env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"  # For PowerShell

To run jobscrapper.py:
flask --app jobscrapper run

To set flask in debug mode:
set FLASK_DEBUG=1 && flask run
